Olympic Rings in Processing
CREATIVE CODING CLASS | PADILLA | ALHS | 2018


# GOALS For This Assignment

1. Practicing using Processing 
2. Practice using the ”ellipse” command in Processing 
3. Understand draw order and command ordering 
4. Understand the Processing 2D coordinate systems 
5. Recreate the Olympic Rings


# RESOURCES 

Your program might use the following functions (some more than once):

strokeWeight()
stroke()
ellipse()
size()
noFill()



# OPTIONAL Challenge

Your Olympic rings don't have to look like any of the samples below. Feel free to read about other Processing functions and add other elements to your Olympic rings design. If you want a challenge, you might try to use the arc() function instead of ellipse() to make interlocking rings like the two programs below.
